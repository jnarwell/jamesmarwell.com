<h1>sardine_tin</h1>
<p id="desc">This is a small pendant designed to look like a sardine tin. I designed this necklace as a part of Stanfordâ€™s FashionX jewelry team. After completing the model in Blender I 3D printed the part using castable was on a Formlabs SLA 3D printer. The 3D cast was sent to a silversmith and rendered in silver. Finally, once returned, I finished the part and attached a chain so as to be worn.</p>
