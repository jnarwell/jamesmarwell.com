        This is a small pendant designed to look like a sardine tin. Working with my friend Oivia (who provided the awesome drawings you'll soon be able to see) we made this necklace as a part of Stanford's FashionX jewelry team.

        After Olivia finished a final detailed sketch, I modeled the sardine tin, then, 3D printed the part using castable wax on a SLA printer. The 3D cast was sent to a silversmith and rendered in silver.

        Once returned, I finished the part (sanding, polishing, touching up) and attached a chain so as to be worn as a necklace.
