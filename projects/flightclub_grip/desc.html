<h1>flightclub_grip</h1>
<p id="desc">This grip is designed to be placed over the main control stick of an ultralight plane designed and manufactured by Flightclub Aerospace, an ultralight engineering club based in San Francisco. This is one of several projects designed for the club. The exterior of the grip was modeled in Blender for greater control over the aesthetic and feel. The interior was done in Solidworks to ensure reliability and fit.</p>
