        This is an on-the-go cereal container, designed for ME1, intro to mechanical engineering. For the assignment, each group of three was tasked with a random everyday problem, anything from dispensing candy to holding a banana, and asked to design a mechanical solution. My group was prompted to fix our professor's most persistent problem: eating cereal while commuting to work.

        After various iterations, we developed this device, a completely self-contained cereal tube. The product holds three compartments: one for cereal at the very bottom, and two (each half the size of the cereal container) for the milk and a custom spoon directly above it. When the center is rotated 90 degrees, the milk drops into the cereal container which can then be completely detached.

        The separation mechanism is held in place by a 3D printed spring that, when pressed, frees the mechanism to rotate and then locks back into place when released. By dividing the components of cereal, we ensured that no matter when the user wanted their meal, it would be a fresh bowl, not a soggy goop.

        With a generally simple design, the primary challenge was in figuring out a locking mechanism. We tried a variety of more complex designs but each was too clunky or unreliable. In the end, combining a printed spring (which could be modeled perfectly to the space) and including a guiding channel for the center to slide along as it actuated, served as the perfect solution to our space and reliability challenges. I also performed 3D print finishing work to improve the function of the printed threads.
