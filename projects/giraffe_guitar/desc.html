<h1>giraffe_guitar</h1>
<p id="desc">This is a custom stratocaster guitar designed and manufactured for a friend. The base concept for the design is a giraffe, in which spots are imposed and extruded into the body of the guitar. The initial modeling was done in Solidworks and the main body was machined using the Solidworks cam. This was my first major CNC milling project and outside of the core design, the most difficult aspect of the project was learning to use the mill itself. After being machined from Alder, the main body was finished, painted, and lacquered to ensure durability. This was my first (but not last) guitar design and a truly transformative project.</p>
