<p id="desc">This is the primary project I worked on while interning at Navier, an electric hydrofoiling maritime startup based in Alameda, California. The high voltage control box serves as the primary high voltage control for the boat’s two rear motors, directing and regulating the flow of high voltage power from the boat’s battery supply. This project involved a combination of mechanical work on the enclosure and related hardware, and electrical design, determining the electrical layout of fuses, contactors, and connectors. The box was modeled in Solidworks, manufactured in China, and assembled on site in Alameda. This project allowed me to exercise the non-academic skills involved with product realization (i.e. sourcing parts, working with manufacturers, etc.). This 3D model is a representation of my actual product as to protect Navier’s IP.</p>
