        This project is a custom assistive device called the Poop-Dozer, designed to help wheelchair users with service dogs independently manage their pets' waste. Based on direct interviews with Danny Stickney, a wheelchair user with limited grip strength and vision, this functional prototype addresses a daily challenge that impacts autonomy.

        The Assistive-Dozer features a stainless steel frame with 3D-printed mounting components that attach securely to a wheelchair. The design incorporates a manually triggered rolling mechanism that enables single-handed operation, collecting and containing waste efficiently while remaining compatible with wheelchair mobility.

        Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with assistive technology design and developed an appreciation for user-centered engineering. The completed device successfully demonstrated waste collection capabilities during testing, proving significantly more effective than commercial alternatives that require two-handed operation or assistance from others.
