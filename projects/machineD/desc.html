        This project is a modern reimagining of the ancient catapult, designed for ME102's final project to launch ping pong balls with precision. Through the MEDGI (Map, Educe, Disrupt, Gestalt, Integrate) design process, we transformed the traditional counterweight system into a compact, spring-powered mechanism.

        Machine D features custom 3D-printed PET-G springs, a steel wire-connected ratchet gear system, and an interlocking lattice foot design that provides stability with a low center of gravity. The sliding bar mechanism converts rotational motion into linear force, efficiently storing potential energy in the springs before release.

        Through this project, we applied engineering principles including trajectory calculations, finite element analysis, and mechanical advantage optimization. The completed device demonstrates the evolution of siege technology into an artistic mechanism that balances form with mechanical function, showcasing how ancient principles can be reimagined with modern manufacturing techniques.
