        This project is a recreation of the T-800's foot from the movie Terminator. This was designed for ME1, introduction to mechanical engineering, as a demonstration of proficiency in 3D design and actuation.

        The foot was modeled in Onshape with mounting geometry for various hardware. The design features connections via pins running between the foot and toes, and was conceived as a custom prosthetic with the ball connecting to a leg component.

        This was a design project that focused on low tolerance component interaction. Through this project, I developed skills in designing parts that fit together procissley and functioned as a full mechanical system (a foot!).
