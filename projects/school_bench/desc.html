<h1>school_bench</h1>
<p id="desc">This is a school bench for a local elementary school in San Francisco, designed for the class ‘Private Skills for a Public Purpose’. For this assignment my group was tasked with connecting to a local institution and designing something to aid their mission. After contacting the school they told us that they were in desperate need of new benches for their courtyard. Specifically, they needed child-sized, long lasting structures. The goal of our design was to build benches that were simple to manufacture and resistant to the elements as we were tasked with building eight benches to send. The product is made from 11 pieces of wood, treated for outdoor use, that are either simple rectangles or rectangles with cutouts that can be manufactured on a CNC mill. The pieces all fit together through their cut joints and were bound with adhesive and screws. The benches were painted white so that the students could (and did!) paint them.</p>
