<p id="desc">This is a hole placement jig produced while at Navier Boat. By aligning to the geometry of the bow, the jig correctly orients (and contains drill bushings for) the hole. This project featured Solidworks molding as the front bow is a non-standard surface. The model shown is a semi-accurate recreation to respect IP, cetrain features have been altered (i.e. # of holes, mounting geometry, etc.). </p>
