<h1>abstract_pendant</h1>
<p id="desc">This is an abstract pendant designed for Stanfordâ€™s FashionX Jewelry Team. The necklace was modeled in Blender for greater flexibility and a less rigid design. After being designed and printed in castable wax the piece was sent to a Silversmith and rendered in silver. On return, I finished the piece and added a chain so it could be worn.</p>
