        This is an abstract pendant designed for Stanford's FashionX Jewelry Team. The necklace was modeled in Blender for greater felxibility.
    
    <p>
        After being designed, the piece was 3D printed in castable wax and sent to a silversmith to be cast in silver.

        On return, I finished the piece and added a chain so it could be worn as jewelry.
