        This is a costume headpiece for a Wall-E halloween costume. I designed these eyes as a portion of the costume and attached them to my head using an elastic band and clasp. The design is a near recreation of Wall-E's eyes in the movie with holes to include actual hardware.

        The eyes were modeled in Onshape and Blender, then 3D printed. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I was unable to finish the eyes with paint as intended. The major challenge of this project was mapping the contact point between the headpiece and my head itself, for which I used a custom linkage to measure and set the shape of my head.

        This project allowed me to explore the difficulty of making human-interfacing components and develop tools to measure interaction geometry. I created a custom strap system with clips on the back to ensure the headpiece would stay securely in place while being comfortable to wear.
