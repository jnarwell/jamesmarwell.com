<h1>wallE</h1>
<p id="desc">This is a costume headpiece for a wallE halloween costume. I designed these eyes as a portion of the costume and attached them to my head using an elastic band and clasp. The design is a near recreation of wallEâ€™s eyes in the movie with holes to include actual hardware. The eyes were then 3D printed. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I was unable to finish the eyes with paint as intended. The major challenge of this project was mapping the contact point between the headpiece and my head itself, for which I used a custom linkage to measure and set the shape of my head.</p>
