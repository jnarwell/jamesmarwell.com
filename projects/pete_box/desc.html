        PETE Box is a lockable teaching aid inspired by the same‑named PETE Box in Terry Rudolph’s <em>Q is for Quantum</em>. One box acts like a single quantum transistor: a white‑ball input (0) returns white, a black‑ball input (1) returns black. Two boxes stacked together form a 2‑transistor “entangled” pair whose lids unlock and relock in unison.

        Mechanism&nbsp;–&nbsp;Inside one box, a dropped ball enters a Y‑shaped channel: the left branch lets the ball pass straight through to the output, while the right branch drops it onto a print‑in‑place flipper. The flipper swaps the ball’s color and stores the original under a latch, then resets. When two boxes are magnetically stacked, an interlocking cam forces the flippers open, turning the channel into a straight pass‑through so the ball flows cleanly through both boxes and re‑emerges unchanged.

        Only the lock assembly (cam, flipper, snap latch) prints in place; the surrounding frame is printed separately for smoother surfaces and color options. Parametric SolidWorks models set 0.30 mm radial / 0.15 mm axial gaps, guiding six rapid FDM prototypes before the final PLA print at 0.20 mm layers. The finished pair highlights additive manufacturing’s ability to embed motion and precise alignment without post‑assembly.
