<h1>nanofab_washer</h1>
<p id="desc">This project was my primary responsibility while interning at Nanofabrica, a micron-scale 3D printing startup based in Tel Aviv, Israel. While working virtually I interned under the company’s head of engineering to build this, an automatic washing machine for the company’s DLP 3D printed parts. As the company was small and all their full time engineers were focussed on the company’s main product, their 3D printer, they had not developed a customer facing solution for DLP postprocessing. Instead, during R&D, the company simply attached the bed of the 3D printer to a drill and spun the printed parts within a vat of Isopropyl alcohol. This machine automates the process for customers, washing the parts first in a dirty vat (which is reused) and then switching the part to a clean vat (made of fresh IPA). The product was modeled in Solidworks and manufactured on site. </p>
