        This project is a recreation of the ancient Archimedean screw, a water-lifting device that was widely used throughout the Roman Empire. Based on Vitruvius's detailed descriptions in "Ten Books on Architecture," this functional model demonstrates Roman hydraulic engineering principles.

        The screw was constructed following Vitruvian proportions and techniques, with adaptations for modern materials. The design features a central beam with a helical blade that, when rotated at the proper angle, efficiently transports water upward from a lower elevation through the spiral chambers.

        Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with ancient engineering practices and developed an appreciation for Roman technological innovations. The completed screw successfully demonstrated water-lifting capabilities during testing, proving significantly more efficient than manual water scooping methods.
